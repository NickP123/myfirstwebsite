  <h3>About</h3>

<p>What is PRACTivate?</p>

 <p>PRACTivate is a business incubator that reduces crime and re-offense in local communities. They achieve this by launching social enterprises designed, developed and managed by young adults who are Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET), who have gained business experience in gang organisations, or as street entrepreneurs.</p>
 
 <p>PRACTivate’s model is one that inherently addresses global challenges in the course of its normal operation, including: 

<ul>Social Inclusion</ul>
<ul>Breaking the Cycle of Re-offense</ul>
<ul>Turning Perpetrators to Pioneers</ul>
 
 <h3>Incubator</h3>
   
   <p>At completion, participants in our PRACTivate program have career opportunities with PRACTivate, one of our linked Social Franchises, Corporate Partners or an invitation to develop their own social enterprise with the support of the Keepin’ It R.E.A.L. Social Enterprise Incubator.</p>
